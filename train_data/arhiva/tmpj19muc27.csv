pyro materials will be used
• Fire gels only to be used and applied by competent SFX crew or stunt personnel if to a performer
• Gels to be kept off set when not in use and in tightly closed metal cans
• All combustible materials not used in scene to be moved. All unmovable objects to be
fireproofed /damped down if required.
• Firefighting media will be on set during effect
• Gel should be applied with disposable brushes and care to be taken not to contaminate clothing etc with the
gel.
• Gel should be applied in a well ventilated area, a mask should be warn if there is any risk of fume build up.

safety interlocks that prevent the firing circuit being energized until the pyro device(s) are
ready to be fired (this is achieved through a combination of battery connections, safety plugs and appropriate
keys and switches).
• Wiring from pyro device to a firing box will be made secure and positioned so as to avoid
damage and interference by objects and/or personnel.
